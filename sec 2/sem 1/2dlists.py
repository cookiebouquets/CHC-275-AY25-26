2DLists.py

In the first semester we only really dealt with one data structure: A kind of storage procedure that 
stores a bunch of variables under one name 
    - List
    
In the second semester we are going to work with two new data structures
    - 2D List
    - Dictionary 
    
Recall things about 1D Lists:
    - Mutable (they can change in length)
    - Yes 
    - How do we get single elements out of a list? square brackets
    mylist[i] <- i is an index 
    - what is the starting index of a list: 0
    - .append(val) <=adds things
    - .remove(val)
    - .pop(index)
    
2D lists are practically the same thing with one change: rather than storing individual values
inside the list, we are just storing lists inside of those lists.

""" 
Now instead of one list containing a bunch of numbers, I have a single list, containing multiple lists
inside of it. This is a natural thing to consider

    - 2D games are laid out in this way 
    
to get a single value out of a 2D list

 The way 2D lists grow is from:
 
    -top to bottom, then left to right.
    
Different than a regular coordinate plane because [0][0] is really the "origin". 

for-each loop
for-i loop
while loop

In terms of traversing a 1D list:
    1) for-each loop: easiest to use, the trade off was num is a going to be copies of the elements
    of the list, so we can't directly modify the list
    2) for-i loops: not as easy to use, but we can directly access the list so we have more flexibility
    3) while loops: have the most flexibility because our exit condition doesn't strictly involve the list
    but it's up to you to figure out what the exit conditions are.
